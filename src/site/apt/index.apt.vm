Apache Tomcat Maven Plugin

  This is the new home for the Tomcat Maven Plugin (previously hosted at Codehaus).

  The version ${project.version} have the following new features:

  * Apache Tomcat7 support

  * {{{./executable-war-jar.html}Build an Executable War/Jar}}

  []

  More details in {{{./jira-report.html}Generated changelog from issue tracker}}.

  The Tomcat Maven Plugin provides goals to manipulate WAR projects within the {{{http://tomcat.apache.org/}Apache Tomcat}} servlet container.

* groupId and Mojo name change

  Since version 2.0-beta-1 tomcat mojos has been renamed to tomcat6 and tomcat7 with the same goals.

  You must configure your pom to use this new groupId:

+----------
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>tomcat6-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
+----------

  Or add the groupId in your settings.xml

+----------
  <pluginGroups>
    ....
    <pluginGroup>org.apache.tomcat.maven</pluginGroup>
    ....
  </pluginGroups>
+----------


* Goals Overview


  * {{{./context-goals.html}Goals to manipulate deployed projects within Tomcat}}

  * {{{./container-goals.html}Goals to obtain information from Tomcat}}

  * {{{./executable-war-jar.html}Build an Executable War/Jar}}

  []

* Know limitations

  Some goals are not yet available in tomcat7 mojo. Those {{{./container-goals.html}contains goals}} are available with
  the tomcat6 mojo, you only need to update the manager url in your pom.

   Use <<<http://localhost:8080/manager/html>>> rather than the default tomcat6 url.
